# Ghiblicord Chat App
This challenge was provided by @Alura's React Mini Bootcamp.

### Description:
This simple chat app uses the user's github username to access the chat page. The messages can be text or gifs/stickers and also can be sent and deleted in real time. 

⚠️The app does not provide any authentication so users can use any github username.

⚠️The messages can be deleted by any user.

### Next Steps/Improvements
My next steps with this project, besides completing the rest of the challenges, is to make the code cleaner by separating the 'MessageList' component from the 'chat' page. I also want to improve the code in terms of dealing with errors so it doesn't affect the user's experience.
