# Ghiblicord Chat App
This challenge was provided by @Alura's React Mini Bootcamp.

### Description:
This simple chat app uses the user's github username to access the chat page. The messages can be text or gifs/stickers and also can be sent and deleted in real time. 

⚠️The app does not provide any authentication so users can use any github username.
#
### Stacks:
- React
- Styled Components 💅
- NextJS
- Supabase
#
### Challenges:
- Customize the app with a theme of my choice ✅
- Show the user's profile pic only if the input has 2 or more  characters ✅
- Use Github API to access and show other information about the user ✅
- Style '404' in a fun way ❌
- Add a button to send the message ✅
- Add a button to delete the message ✅
- Add a loading effect before showing messages ❌
- Add a box/card with github info when hovering the profile pic on a user's message ❌

### Next Steps/Improvements
My next steps with this project, besides completing the rest of the challenges, is to make the code cleaner by separating the 'MessageList' component from the 'chat' page. I also want to improve the code in terms of dealing with errors so it doesn't affect the user's experience.
